This blog is where I share what I build, what worked, and what I'd change next time. Posts are short, practical, and based on real project work from this portfolio.

## What you can expect

Most posts are quick reads with clear takeaways:

- Design choices and why I made them
- Development patterns I keep reusing
- Small experiments that taught me something useful

## Why I'm writing these notes

I learn best when I explain decisions out loud, and writing helps me do that. It also gives future clients and teammates a clean way to see how I think through tradeoffs.

Some entries will be polished, others will be rough field notes. Both matter, because the process is part of the result.
