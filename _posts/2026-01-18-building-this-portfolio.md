My goal with this portfolio was to keep things minimal, fast, and readable while still feeling intentional.

Some principles I followed:

- Keep the layout simple and spacious.
- Use motion sparingly to guide attention.
- Treat content as the product: clear hierarchy, strong typography, and good contrast.
