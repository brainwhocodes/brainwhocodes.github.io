This portfolio started as an experiment, I gave an LLM a reference website and asked it to rebuild the feel with only minimal tweaks. I wanted to see how far AI-assisted coding could go before manual edits became the faster path.

I ran this test in February 2026 and kept the rules tight. The model could follow the structure and style direction, but changes had to stay small and intentional.

## How I set up the experiment

I used one reference site and a short prompt brief with clear constraints:

- Keep the layout clean and readable on mobile and desktop.
- Match the overall rhythm of sections, type scale, and spacing.
- Allow only minimal tweaks for color, copy, and micro-interactions.

## What the LLM handled well

The first draft came together fast. It produced working page structure, sensible CSS organization, and a solid visual starting point from the reference.

It also did a good job with repeatable sections, cards, and responsive behavior. That saved time in the early build phase.

## Where I still stepped in

The model overcomplicated a few details, so I trimmed extra wrappers, tightened spacing, and tuned text hierarchy by hand. I also adjusted motion so it felt subtle and useful instead of busy.

## What I learned

With a strong reference and clear constraints, an LLM can get you most of the way quickly. The last stretch still needs human judgment, especially for tone, polish, and small UX calls that make the site feel intentional.
